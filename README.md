# web2-PROJECT
I am creating a website based on the knowledge I gained from a training course of gomycode.
The website is designed for an online store where products can be sold with integrated online payment capabilities.
My main focus currently is on developing the frontend of the website.
As I continue to learn and enhance my skills in backend development,
I plan to further improve the functionality and features of this website

 Food e-commerce website:
1-You can access the product's description by clicking on it.
2-You can add products to your cart.
3-You can check-out.
